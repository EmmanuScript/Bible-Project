      "Galatians 1:1-17 - Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— and all the brothers and sisters with me, To the churches in Galatia: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse! Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.",

      "Galatians 1:18-2:10 - Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days. I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” And they praised God because of me. Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain. Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message. On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised. For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.",

      "Galatians 2:11-21 - When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? “We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. “But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker. “For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”",

      "Galatians 3:1-25 - You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain? So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? So also Abraham ‘believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.’ Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: 'All nations will be blessed through you.' So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because 'the righteous will live by faith.' The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, 'The person who does these things will live by them.' Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.' He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say 'and to seeds,' meaning many people, but 'and to your seed,' meaning one person, who is Christ. What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise. Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one. Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.",

      "Galatians 3:26-4:20 - So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world. But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship. Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, 'Abba, Father.' So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them. It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!",

    verses:
      "Galatians 4:21-5:6 - Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise. These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written: 'Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.' Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. But what does Scripture say? 'Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.' Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.",

      "Galatians 5:7-6:18 - You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. 'A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.' I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves. Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, for each one should carry their own load. Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation. Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God. From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.",

      "1 Peter 1:1-12 - Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God’s elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.",

      "1 Peter 1:13-2:10 - Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming. As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: 'Be holy, because I am holy.' Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God. Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart. For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. For, 'All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of the Lord endures forever.' And this is the word that was preached to you. Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him— you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.' Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,' and, 'A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.' They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for. But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.",

      "1 Peter 2:11-3:9 - Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor. Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 'He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.' When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. 'He himself bore our sins' in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; 'by his wounds you have been healed.' For 'you were like sheep going astray,' but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. For, 'Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.' Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. 'Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.' But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.",

They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.' Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?

But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits— to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you. But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit. The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen. Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, 'If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?' So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.",

      "1 John 2:1-17 - My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. Whoever says, 'I know him,' but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did. Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness. Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them. I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.",

They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is what he promised us—eternal life. I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him. And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.",

      "1 John 3:1-24 - See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister. For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous. Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence: If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.",

      "1 John 4:1-21 - Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.",

This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ.

It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another. And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love. I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work. I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.

      "2 Peter 1:1-21 - Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble, and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.' We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.",

      "2 Peter 2:1-22 - But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment; if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord. But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish. They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood! They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness. But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness. These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for 'people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.' If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: 'A dog returns to its vomit,' and, 'A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.'",

      "3 John 1:1-15 - The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth. Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you. They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God. It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans. We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth. I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us. So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church. Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God. Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true. I have much to write to you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink. I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings.

    <h2>Romans 1:1-32</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 2:1-29</h2>
      <p><strong>1 You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 For God does not show favoritism.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>1 What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 ruin and misery mark their ways,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 and the way of peace they do not know.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 4:1-25</h2>
      <p><strong>1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 “Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 5:1-21</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 perseverance, character; and character, hope.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 6:1-23</h2>
      <p><strong>1 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 7:1-25</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 8:1-39</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>36 As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 9:1-33</h2>
      <p><strong>1 I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 As he says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 and, “In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 It is just as Isaiah said previously: “Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>33 As it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 10:1-21</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 “or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 11:1-36</h2>
      <p><strong>1 I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 “Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 12:1-21</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 On the contrary:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 13:1-14</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.</strong></p>

      <h2>Romans 15:1-33</h2>
      <p><strong>1 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>I will sing the praises of your name.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 Again, it says,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 And again,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>let all the peoples extol him.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 And again, Isaiah says,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“The Root of Jesse will spring up,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>one who will arise to rule over the nations;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>in him the Gentiles will hope.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 Rather, as it is written:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Those who were not told about him will see,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>and those who have not heard will understand.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>33 The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>4 I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 so no one can say that you were baptized in my name.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 so that no one may boast before him.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”</strong></p>

      <h2>1 Corinthians 2:1-16</h2>
      <p><strong>1 And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived”— the things God has prepared for those who love him—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 for, “Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</strong></p>

        <h2>1 Corinthians 3:1-23</h2>
        <p><strong>1 Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3 You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>8 The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>9 For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>10 By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>12 If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>13 their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>14 If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>15 If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>16 Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>20 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>23 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1 This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2 Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3 I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4 My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>6 Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>7 For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>9 For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>10 We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>11 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>12 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>13 when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>14 I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>15 Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>16 Therefore I urge you to imitate me.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>17 For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>19 But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>20 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1 If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2 Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4 Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>5 I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>6 But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>7 The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>8 Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men</strong></p>
        <p><strong>10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>12 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>13 You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>14 By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>16 Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>17 But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>19 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>20 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.</strong></p>

      <h2>1 Corinthians 7:1-40</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>16 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>17 Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>18 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>21 Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>22 For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>23 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>24 Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>25 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>26 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27 Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>29 What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>30 those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>31 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>32 I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>33 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—</strong></p>
      <p><strong>34 and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>35 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>36 If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is

 not sinning. They should get married.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>37 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>38 So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>39 A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>40 In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</strong></p>

      <h2>1 Corinthians 8:1-13</h2>
      <p><strong>1 Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 But whoever loves God is known by God.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”),</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6 yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7 But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8 But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9 Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10 For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>11 So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>12 When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13 Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.</strong></p>

    <h2>1 Corinthians 9:1-27</h2>
    <p><strong>1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 Don’t we have the right to food and drink?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1 For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 They all ate the same spiritual food</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>13 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>29 I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30 If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>32 Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—</strong></p>
    <p><strong>33 even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.</strong></p>

    <h2>1 Corinthians 11:1-34</h2>
    <p><strong>1 Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>28 Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>29 For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>31 But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>32 Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>33 So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>34 Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And when I come I will give further directions.</strong></p>

    <h2>1 Corinthians 12:1-31</h2>
    <p><strong>1 Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 If they were all one part, where would the body be?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>28 And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>31 Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way.</strong></p>

    <h2>1 Corinthians 14:1-40</h2>
    <p><strong>1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 In the Law it is written: “With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>34 Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>37 If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>38 But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>39 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.</strong></p>

    <h2>1 Corinthians 15:1-58</h2>
    <p><strong>1 Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>23 But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>24 Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>27 For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>28 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>29 Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30 And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>31 I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>32 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>33 Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>34 Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>35 But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>36 How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>37 When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>38 But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>39 Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>40 There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>41 The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>42 So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>45 So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>46 The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>47 The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>48 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>49 And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>50 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—</strong></p>
    <p><strong>52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>55 “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>57 But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>58 Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1 Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3 Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4 If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>5 After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6 Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7 For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8 But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9 because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>10 When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>11 No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>12 Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>13 Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>14 Do everything in love.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>15 You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters,</strong></p>
    <p><strong>16 to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>17 I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>19 The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>20 All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>21 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>22 If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord!</strong></p>
